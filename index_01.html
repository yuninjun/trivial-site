        Part A – Create Basic Website
        
        Each student will create a website with several web pages that use HTML5, CSS3 and images. Students are expected to implement fully functional navigation between the pages. You will need to create a website to show case your abilities – an online portfolio of your work. The website should consist of several pages with properly implemented navigation between them. At a minimum, your website should consist of at least three web pages. You are encouraged to have more pages if doing so provides a better user experience. When designing and implementing the website, you need to keep the following requirements in mind:
        
        Showcase your existing work and, if appropriate, provide narrative for it. Highlight your talents and abilities.
        
        Project a professional image. Your audience is prospective employers, clients or recruitment agents.
        
        Provide a method for interested parties to contact you.
        
        Your website should work well on a desktop computer with Firefox and Chrome.
